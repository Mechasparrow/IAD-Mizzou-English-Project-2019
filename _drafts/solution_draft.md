DISCLAIMER:‌Given that Social Media addiction/Internet addiction disorder has several causes, please don't take this as an all-encompassing solution.

As we have mentioned previously, IAD/SMA has several causes. By reducing the causes, one can begin exerting control over their lives again and beat the addiction. 

## Increase Personal Locus of Control and Decrease Fear of Missing Out

To increase one's personal locus of control, they can begin with what they believe they have control of and work towards pushing that internal boundary. Our locus of control hinges on the beliefs of how much we have control over what happens to us and how much chance plays a factor in our lives.   

Decreasing Fear of Missing Out is a similar process. It has been found that FOMO is correlated with one's 

* efficacy (ability to perform an intended action)
* autonomy (ability to make meaningful choices)  
* relatedness (feeling connected to others).

By working to improve these basic psychological needs, FOMO will decrease as a result. 

## Change one's interactions with technology

By changing how one interacts with the technology, they can begin shifting away from addictive behaviors.

To start, time can be scheduled specifically for the use of social media and the Internet. This scheduled time can then be shortened to a reasonable and healthy amount day by day. 

This allows time for individuals to develop new behaviors in response to certain cues that will trigger the impulsive social media/internet usage.

There are also apps that are designed to prevent the usage of other apps during certain periods of the day.
