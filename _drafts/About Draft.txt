# About

Hello and welcome to the website on Internet Addiction Disorder and Social Media Addiction. 

As technology and the internet grows and changes, it serves as a tool to connect with others and achieve more than what can be done with human ability alone. Just like any tool, it can be misused/abused leading to the potential harm of ourselves and others.

Here you will find pages talking about why Internet addiction is a problem, how it can be solved/alleviated, and resources for those wanting to learn more or seeking help. 

The website is partially inspired by a research paper I‌ did in my College Composition class. You can read it here.
